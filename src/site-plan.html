      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>You&apos;re reading this on a computer or mobile device. That&apos;s pretty common, right? Do you ever think about how it got to be that way? What happened to all those inventions?</p>
      <p>Flibberdy Gibbits&apos; Bits points the way to the interesting inventions behind today&apos;s technological wonders and the history (and some wild stories) behind the electronics we use every day.</p>
      <p>Browse the bits we&apos;ve rescued in our shop â€“ who knows, you might find something to bring home. We also give old electronics a good home or we make sure it&apos;s safely disposed to protect the environment. We want our technological history to be a good one.</p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The main audience is expected to be those that have grown up in the 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s and will most likely have been exposed to that era's technology explosion and developed an affinity for diving in - folks otherwise known as &apos;Nerds of the First Water&apos;. This audience is expected to want to take advantage of participating mostly in the shop.</p>
      <p>We also want to invite the younger generation to browse the learning links and the shop with the purpose of providing a historical perspective.</p>

      <h2>Style Guide</h2>

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/000000-1c1c1c-f9f9e9-adad8b-596869-c05746-daa520-259963" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/000000-1c1c1c-f9f9e9-adad8b-596869-c05746-daa520-259963</a>

      <table class="colors">
        <tr>
          <th>Background 1</th>
          <th>Background 2</th>
          <th>Primary</th>
          <th>Secondary</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="bkg1">#000000</td>
          <td class="bkg2">#1C1C1C</td>
          <td class="primary">#F9F9E9</td>
          <td class="secondary">#ADAD8B</td>
        </tr>
      </table><br>
      <p>Like most displays of the era, background color was almost always black with perhaps a faint glow from a poorly tuned CRT, thus the second background. The primary and secondary colors are chosen to limit eye-strain by avoiding the blue spectrum prevalent in much lighter (whiter) colors.</p>

      <table class="colors">
        <tr>
          <th>Accent 1</th>
          <th>Accent 2</th>
          <th>Accent 3</th>
          <th>Accent 4</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="accent1">#596869</td>
          <td class="accent2">#C05746</td>
          <td class="accent3">#DAA520</td>
          <td class="accent4">#259963</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The accent colors are chosen to be close to those found on circuit boards. Because of the number of colors in this palette, the accent colors will be used carefully.</p>

      <h3>Typography</h3>

      <h4>Heading Font: Orbitron</h4>
      <p>
        This Google open-font was chosen because its style is reminiscent of late 20th century typography associated with technology and science fiction. Because this font is closely spaced, CSS letter-spacing is used to assist legibility. Although this font has a limited glyph set, it is appropriate for the intended audience.
      </p>

      <h4>Paragraph Font: Raleway</h4>
      <p>
        Raleway, another Google open-font  is a sans-serif font designed for display. The author likes to draw fonts for video games, which seem appropriate for this site&apos;s purpose. The fone was tested against Orbitron in Google&apos;s pairing simulator and appears very clear type that is more clear than many of the sans-serif fonts that were researched.
      </p>

      <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
      <p>
        Flibberdy Bibbets&apos; Bits is a technological tinkerer&apos;s shop. We like all the old bits that someone might throw out because you never know what little treasures hide in those old bits. We rescue, refurbish and rebuild as much as we can so we can share a historical perspective of how we got to where we are now and what it took to make it all happen. The magic is still there if you know where to look.

      <p><span class="strong">Who we are&hellip;</span> You&apos;re reading this on a computer or mobile device. That&apos;s pretty common, right? Do you ever think about how it got to be that way? What happened to all those inventions?</p>

      <p>Flibberdy Gibbets&apos; Bits is a technological tinkerer's shop. We like all the old bits that someone might throw out because you never know what little treasures hide in those old bits. We rescue, refurbish and rebuild as much as we can so we can share a historical perspective of how we got to where we are now and what it took to make it all happen. The magic is still there if you know where to look.</p>

      <p><span class="strong">Love to learn&hellip;</span> It&apos;s important to appreciate the history behind the technology that&apos;s part of our everyday lives. A lot of work went into making important discoveries in material science, manufacturing processes, and miniaturization. There's still a lot of work ahead as new ideas are always pushing boundaries.</p>
      <p>We&apos;re working on additions to our website that will feature photos and historical backgrounds on the gadgets we rescue. It&apos;s not quite ready yet, so keep checking back for updates. In the meantime, here are some links that might lead to some learning (be careful!):</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_transistor" target="_blank">History of the transistor</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware" target="_blank">History of the computer</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://vcfed.org/wp/about" target="_blank">Vintage Computer Federation</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p><span class="strong">Rescue, Rehab, Recycle</span>&nbsp; We do our best to rescue the good stuff, repair it and give it a new home. These old electronics may not have a place in the mainstream of all the new technology, but they make great educational and collector&apos;s items. Who knows, you might find something of ours on a movie set... they still make old movies, right?</p>
      <p>Sometimes we can't rescue something or maybe there&apos;s leftover parts we can&apos;t use. Those things we give special attention to recover the metals or other materials that should never make their way to a landfill. We don't want our technological history to be stained by environmental damage.</p>

      <h3>Shop</h3>
      <div>
        <p><span class="strong">Welcome to The Shop.</span> We're tinkering with things and getting them ready for the showroom floor where you can browse and maybe feel good about taking one or two home... if your significant other will let you.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, if you need room in your garage (for a motorcycle?) and you'd like to donate some of those old electronic gadgets, we'd like to hear about it.</p>
        <p>We accept reasonably clean (not dripping with toxic waste) donations. We'll salvage what we can and make sure all else is safely handled to minimize negative impact to the environment.</p>
        <p>If you're particularly attached to your gadget and would like us to take a look at it for repair, let us know. Sometimes a tinkerer needs a side job, too.</p>
        <p>We will sometimes purchase the really good stuff so if you think you have one of those special gadgets, send us a photo.</p>
        <p>Complete the form to the right so we can get in touch with you.</p>

        <p class="colored">[Form: First name, Last name, Address, Description box, radio buttons, checkboxes, Upload and Submit buttons]</p>

        <p><span class="strong">Gadgets That Need A Home</span> We&apos;Sorry! Our shop floor was browsed by many and they took a bunch of stuff home. Now we don&apos;t have anything to show you!</p>
        <p>Check back with us often and donate if you can.</p>
